# React-Draggable-Web-GUI
Created with CodeSandbox<br></br>
This App demonstrates a drag and drop interface where the sidebar can add a component or 'widget' to an array of widgets in App.js. For the length of widgets, each component is rendered and then the app is refreshed.<br></br>
An onClick handler manages the Z-Index of different componenets to give the interface a OS style feel.
